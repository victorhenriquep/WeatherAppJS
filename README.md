This is the implementation of a Weather Application using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. My objective with this project is to create an online application where users can check the weather for any region they want. In addition, I want to practice the basic front-end languages as much as possible to develop my learning and get used to commenting codes in english.

You can check the weather and test the application by clicking [HERE.](https://victorhenriquep.github.io/WeatherAppJS)
